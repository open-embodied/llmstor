This guide will walk you through setting up S.I.M.P as a standalone application and exposing it to the internet using Ngrok.

## Prerequisites

- Download the latest standalone release for your operating system from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/DanonekTM/SIMP/releases)
- [Ngrok account](https://ngrok.com) (free tier is sufficient)
- Ngrok CLI installed on your system

## Steps

### 1. Download and Extract

1. Download the appropriate standalone release for your operating system
2. Extract the archive to your desired location

### 2. Configure S.I.M.P

1. Locate the `config.yaml` file in the extracted directory
2. Configure the file according to your needs (refer to the [Configuration Guide](../configuration.mdx))
3. Make sure to set the `server.host` to `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` and choose a port (default is `3000`)

### 3. Set Up Ngrok

1. Sign up for a free Ngrok account if you haven't already
2. Install Ngrok following the [official documentation](https://ngrok.com/download)
3. Authenticate Ngrok with your auth token:
   ```bash
   ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
   ```

### 4. Start S.I.M.P

1. Run the standalone executable:
   - On Windows: Double click the `.exe` file or run it from command prompt
   - On Linux: Make the file executable with `chmod +x ./simp` and run it with `./simp`
2. Verify that S.I.M.P is running by accessing `http://localhost:3000` (or your configured port)

### 5. Start Ngrok Tunnel

1. Open a new terminal window
2. Start Ngrok, pointing to your S.I.M.P port, set in `config.yaml`:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```
3. Ngrok will provide you with a public URL (e.g., `https://random-string.ngrok.io`)

## Important Notes

- The Ngrok URL changes every time you restart Ngrok (unless you have a paid plan)
- Update your ShareX configuration to use the new Ngrok URL
- For production use, consider:
  - Using a paid Ngrok plan for a fixed domain
  - Setting up proper authentication
  - Using a reverse proxy like Nginx or Caddy instead

## Security Considerations

- Always use HTTPS (Ngrok provides this by default)
- Set up authentication in your `config.yaml`
- Be cautious with file permissions
- Monitor your Ngrok dashboard for unusual traffic

## Troubleshooting

- If S.I.M.P isn't accessible via Ngrok:
  - Verify S.I.M.P is running locally
  - Check if the ports match in both S.I.M.P config and Ngrok command
  - Ensure your firewall isn't blocking the connections
  - Check Ngrok's status in their dashboard
