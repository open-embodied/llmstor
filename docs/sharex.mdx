## Step 1: Find Your S.I.M.P Upload Key

To allow ShareX to upload images, you need the **upload key** defined in your S.I.M.P `config.yaml` file.

The upload key is set in your `config.yaml` file under the `upload_key` field.

```yaml
app:
  environment: development
  port: 3000
  domain: "localhost:3000"
  jwt_secret: "your-secret-key-here"
  max_file_size: "1MB"
  uuid_format: "^[A-Za-z0-9]{10}$"
  upload_key: "your-upload-key-here" // [!code highlight]
  ipinfo_token: ""
  ...
```

Copy this value to use as your API key in ShareX.

## Step 2: Create a Custom Uploader in ShareX

1. Open ShareX.
2. Go to **Destinations** > **Custom uploader settings**.
3. Click **New** to create a new uploader.
4. Set the **Method** to `POST`.
5. Set the **Request URL** to your S.I.M.P upload endpoint, e.g.:
   ```
   https://your-simp-domain.com/api/upload
   ```
6. Under **Body**, select `Multipart/form-data` and add a parameter:
   - Name: `key`
   - Value: `upload_key` from [step above](#step-1-find-your-simp-upload-key)
7. Set the **URL** to `{json:full_link}`, this will be used to parse the image URL from the JSON response.

2. If configured correctly, you should see a successful upload and receive a direct image URL.

## Step 4: Verify the Upload in the S.I.M.P Dashboard

1. Open your S.I.M.P dashboard in your browser.
2. Navigate to the **Images** tab.
3. You should see the ShareX logo listed as a newly uploaded image—this confirms your test upload was successful.

## Step 5: Final Steps

Now that your custom uploader is working, let’s make sure your ShareX workflow is as smooth as possible.

1. **Set as Default Uploader**

   - In ShareX, go to **Destinations** > **Image uploader**.
   - Select your newly created S.I.M.P uploader from the list. This ensures all future image uploads will use your S.I.M.P instance by default.

2. **Configure Post-Upload Actions**

   - Go to **After upload tasks** in ShareX settings.
   - Make sure **Copy URL to clipboard** is enabled. This way, every time you upload an image, the direct link will be automatically copied and ready to paste.
   - Optionally, you can also enable **Open URL** if you want to preview uploads instantly.

3. **Test Your Workflow**

   - Take a screenshot using ShareX.
   - After uploading, try pasting (Ctrl+V) in your browser or chat app—the image URL should be ready to go.
   - Visit the URL to confirm your image is accessible.

4. **Enjoy Seamless Uploads!**
   - With these steps complete, you can now quickly upload screenshots and files from ShareX directly to your S.I.M.P instance, with the link instantly available for sharing.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure your S.I.M.P instance is accessible from your computer.
- Double-check your `upload_key` and endpoint URL.
- Check S.I.M.P server logs for any errors if uploads fail.
