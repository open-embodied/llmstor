All non-API routes are handled by the frontend or static file handler.

- **Path:** `/` (catch-all except /api/\*)
- **Source:** [handlers.go](https://github.com/DanonekTM/SIMP/blob/main/backend/internal/handlers/handlers.go)

## Behavior

- Requests to `/api/*` are handled by the API.
- Requests to `/[uuid].[ext]` are handled as image access.
- All other requests serve the frontend (e.g., Single Page App, static assets).
